# DEXSLib

This project aims as an open source library for static backward and forward slicing of Smali code. 

It is build upon [dexlib2](https://github.com/JesusFreke/smali/tree/master/dexlib2).

## Why Slicing?

When it comes to reverse engineering 3rd party, closed, binary Android apps - espcially Android malware - we often have the need to analyse the code based on certain methods or instructions. The direction might be either forward or backwards.
